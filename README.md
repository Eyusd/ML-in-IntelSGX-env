# ML in IntelSGX env

## Intel SGX
A special kind of processors within which instructions are encrypted and cannot be traced by an outide observer.
Sensitive opertions are performed in an enclave, protected and marshalled.

## The project
He we implement a very simple example of gradient descent done in an Intel SGX env. Clone this repo on an Azure Computing Cloud if you do not have the physical processor.
